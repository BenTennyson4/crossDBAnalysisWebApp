This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To use this application, you need to download and install Node.js and npm. Follow this tutorial to do so [`Download and install Node.js and npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Once you have installed npm, you can run a local development server in your web browser, which runs the app in your browser and allows you to see the results of changes to the code in real-time.

Run the development server:

```bash or powershell or cmd
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
